## ðŸ”§ Project Parts

### Part 1: Crawling and Indexing
- Perform a new crawl of **at least 500 pages**.
- Create a **simple inverted index** to map terms to documents.

### Part 2: Simple Retrieval
- Implement a **basic Boolean retrieval system**.
  - No need to support complex operators (e.g., `OR`, `NOT`).
  - Input queries via command line:
    ```
    > Please enter your query: tropical fish  
    > Relevant results are: doc12, doc24, doc45
    ```
  - No GUI required.

### Part 3: Improved Retrieval
- Implement an **advanced retrieval model**, such as:
  - Ranked Boolean
  - Vector Space Model
  - BM25

### Part 4: PageRank
- Compute **PageRank scores** for the pages you crawled.
- You may need to recrawl to ensure enough link data.

### Part 5: Combine
- Combine your retrieval model with PageRank.
  - Example: Multiply retrieval score Ã— PageRank score.
